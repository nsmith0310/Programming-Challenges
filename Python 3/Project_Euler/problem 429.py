###help from s braume with the appropriate modification to legendre's forumla
###which I wrote for problem 231
from math import floor
from euler import primes,power,pmod
def powers(n,m):
    x = primes(n+1)
    t=1
    for y in x:
        total=0
        v = y
        count=1
        while v<=n:
            count+=1
            total+=floor(n/v)
            v=power(y,count)
        ###mainly where s braumme helped (2*total)
        t *=(1+(pmod(y,2*total,m)))%m
        t%=m

        ###we can break out of the search once a total of one is found since
        ###all subsequent primes will be to the power of 1
        if 2*y>n:
            for z in x[x.index(y)+1:]:
                t *=(1+(pmod(z,2,m)))%m
                t %=m
            return t%m
    

lim = 100000000
mod = 1000000009

d = powers(lim,mod)

print(d)
