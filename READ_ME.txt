Thank you for taking the time to browse my collection of programming challenges. The files included run the gammut of simple to very complex. Please let me know if there is a specific file which you would like explained. 

Some files have non-standard dependencies: please let me know if there is a file which any of the current scripts require which is not part of the standard Python 3.7 or C++ 11 libraries, and I can try to include it.

Many of these scripts (not all) are not optimal solutions to their respective problems as they were some of my earliest programs and were my primary means of teaching myself to code.
