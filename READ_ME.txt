Thank you for taking the time to browse my collection of programming challenges. The files included run the gammut of simple to very
complex. Please let me know if there is a specific file which you would like explained. 

Some files have non-standard dependencies: please let me know if there is a file which any of the current scripts requires which is 
not part of the standard Python 3.7 or C++ 11 libraries, and I can try to include it.

Many (but certainly not all) of the Project Euler python scripts are not optimal solutions to the problems, as they were some of my 
earliest programs and were my primary means of teaching myself the language.

There are 287 additional LeetCode python scripts to be added, as I have solved 1000 total unique problems on the platform.
